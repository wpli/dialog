    abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to recognition confidence scoring and a method for integrating confidence scores into the understanding and dialogue components of a speech understanding system. The system uses a multi-tiered approach where confidence scores are computed at the phonetic, word, and utterance levels. The scores are produced by extracting confidence features from the computation of the recognition hypotheses and processing these features using an accept/reject classifier for word and utterance hypotheses. The output of the confidence classifiers can then be incorporated into the parsing mechanism of the language understanding component. To evaluate the system, experiments were conducted using the JUPITER weather information system. Evaluation was performed at the understanding level using key-value pair concept error rate as the evaluation metric. When confidence scores were integrated into the understanding component of the system, the concept error rate was reduced ...}

A good confidence measure can largely benefit speech recognition systems in many practical applications.

I will present all these approaches as three major categories, namely CM as a combination of predictor features, CM as a posterior probability, and CM as utterance verification. Then, I also introduce some recent advances in the area. Moreover, I will discuss capabilities and limitations of the current CM techniques and generally comment on today's CM approaches. Based on the discussion, I will conclude the paper with some clues for future works.}},

It briefly summarises the basic mathematics and explains why exact optimisation is intractable. It then describes in some detail a form of approximation called the Hidden Information State model which does scale and which can be used to build practical systems. A prototype HIS system for the tourist information domain is evaluated and compared with a baseline MDP system using both user simulations and a live user trial. The results give strong support to the central contention that the POMDP-based framework is both a tractable and powerful approach to building more robust spoken dialogue systems

In designing a spoken dialogue system, developers need to specify the actions a system should take in response to user speech input and the state of the environment based on observed or inferred events, states, and beliefs. This is the fundamental task of dialogue management. Researchers have recently pursued methods for automating the design of spoken dialogue management using machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning. In this paper, we discuss how dialogue management is handled in industry and critically evaluate to what extent current state-of-the-art machine learning methods can be of practical benefit to application developers who are deploying commercial production systems. In examining the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, we highlight what academic researchers need to know about commercial deployment if they are to influence the way industry designs and practices dialogue management."

We consider a combined measure of confidence that utilizes the language model back-off sequence, language model score, and phonetic length of recognized words as indicators of speech recognition confidence. The paper investigates the ability of each feature to detect speech recognition errors and out-of-domain utterances as well as two methods for combining the features contextually: a multi-layer perceptron and a statistical decision tree. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by considering utterances from the ATIS airline information task as either in-domain and out-of-domain for the DARPA Communicator task. Using this hand-labeled data, it is shown that 27.9\% of incorrectly recognized words and 36.4\% of out-of-domain phrases are detected at a 2.5\% false alarm rate},

    abstract = {{In this paper we present a new system that assists blind users in orienting themselves in indoor environments. We developed a sensor module that can be handled like a flashlight by a blind user and can be used for searching tasks within the three-dimensional environment. By pressing keys, inquiries concerning object characteristics, position, orientation and navigation can be sent to a connected portable computer, or to a federation of data servers providing models of the environment. Finally these inquiries are acoustically answered over a text-to-speech engine.}},
