This is a GUI based environmental control using arduino and the python
programing language.

It was developed by Sebastian Nowak in July of 2011 for The Boston Home progect at CSAIL at MIT. 

To run:
You will need an arduino board with usb serial wire running "environmentalcontrol.pde"
and a computer running environmentalcontrol.py 
Pins 8 through 13 swtich to positive for a short amount of time after reciving data form the GUI. I conected these to optocouplers closeing switches on a remote controlling ac outlets. 

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please email snowak77@gmail.com


Please note:
This program was writen and tested with an arduino uno and ubuntu 11.04. 
You do not need to have the Arduino SDK installed on the computer you are running 
the program on, but you do need it to upload the code to an ardiono board.
