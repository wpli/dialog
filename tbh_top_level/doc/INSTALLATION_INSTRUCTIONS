GStreamer is the framework used in the speech interface. It requires some
packages from SLS repositories. As a non-free program, Skype is also not
in the Debian repositories.

Add the following sources to /etc/apt/sources.list:

   #deb http://sls:spire@projects.csail.mit.edu/galaxy/apt etch galaxy
   #deb-src http://sls:spire@projects.csail.mit.edu/galaxy/apt etch galaxy
   deb http://download.skype.com/linux/repos/debian/ stable non-free

After adding these sources, run:

   sudo apt-get -y update

# Install dependencies:
* GStreamer
* Qt4
* GData
* Text-to-speech synthesizer (festival)
* pulseaudio
* Skype

Run the following command:
sudo apt-get -y --force-yes install python-gst0.10 gstreamer-tools gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-sls-summitsink libsummit libsummit-dev libfst libfst-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev python-qt4 python-gdata skype python-dbus gsl-bin libgsl0ldbl libgsl0-dev festival pulseaudio libasound2-plugins padevchooser libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio sox python-decorator python-matplotlib

# Install the GStreamer Speech Activity Detector (gstSAD)
In the TBH SVN repository, go to:

    tbh/code/trunk/resident_interface/third-party/gstSAD-0.2.9.2/

Enter the following:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install

# Install Skype4Py

In the TBH SVN repository, go to:

   tbh/code/trunk/resident_interface/third-party/Skype4Py/

Enter the following:

   sudo python setup.py install

# Ensure that PulseAudio is configured correctly

In a console, launch:
   alsamixer

Ensure that the volumes for the master, speaker, and microphone volumes are set
to a reasonable value (they may be set to 0, which is undesirable).

# Determine microphone setup.

In a console, enter the following to determine the sound card device:

   pactl list | grep -A2 'Source #' | cut -d" " -f2

The microphone should be set in tbh_audio_listener.py. the tbh_resident_interface.py file should pass the microphone name that will be used.

# Make folders
cd 
mkdir audio_files
mkdir logfiles
